# DECOMP_STATE — session state for the decompilation workflow

Read this file FIRST, at session start. Companion to DECOMP_TEMPLATE.md.

Rules:
- Entries here are LEADS, never grounding. Anything used in code must be
  re-verified against the reference files and cited as if this file did
  not exist. The greps remain the authority.
- New entries are proposed in the conversation and written only on owner
  approval (DECOMP_TEMPLATE.md constraint 9).
- Every entry carries its citation and how to re-verify. Entries rot;
  the re-verify hint is the invalidation mechanism.

## Verified environment facts

- Reference file sizes (2026-11-14): idb_types.h 37,047 lines;
  idb_functions.h 6,415 lines (6,403 definitions); battlegrounds_x2.c
  15,217,425 bytes / 464,838 lines; battlegrounds_x2.lst 64,337,921 bytes /
  1,111,401 lines; common.h 109 lines; common.cpp 314 lines.
  Re-verify: `(Get-Content <file> | Measure-Object -Line).Lines`
- idb_functions.h address-literal lookups are unique: an address like
  `0x00401970` matches exactly one line (verified 2026-11-14).
  Re-verify: `Select-String -Path cheatdll\src\idb\idb_functions.h -Pattern '0x00401970'`
- battlegrounds_x2.c: every function body is preceded by an
  `//----- (00XXXXXX) -----` address marker (verified at the get_sprite
  body, around :156005).
- battlegrounds_x2.lst: functions are delimited by
  `.text:00XXXXXX <name> proc near` through the matching `endp` line.
  Example: RGE_Master_Static_Object__get_sprite = [0x0048B8B0, 0x0048B910)
  (lst :237299ff). Extent excludes inter-function padding.
- Game .text = [0x00401000, 0x00648000): functionlist.cpp:9210 issues
  VirtualProtect(0x00401000, 0x00247000, ...). 0x401000 + 0x247000 = 0x648000.
- Patch call-site volume ~1,350 across cheatdll\*.cpp (grep of
  setHook/setHookCall/writeNops/write_nop_seq, 2026-11-14). Re-verify: same grep.
- No direct `*(TYPE*)0xADDR = ...` writes exist in cheatdll sources
  (verified 2026-11-14).
- No `enum` definitions in idb_types.h, common.h, common.cpp
  (verified 2026-11-14).
- Full patch-writer inventory (both layers, incl. `reloc` at
  conditions.cpp:871) lives in DECOMP_TEMPLATE.md, "Collision audit".

## Owner rulings

- 2026-11-14: All build configurations patch the same game binary.
  WriteProcessMemory vs the Voobly interface is a load-context detail
  only. No version conditioning in installers.
- 2026-11-14: Every replaced function is named `<Class>__<method>_new`,
  mandatory (canonical names are taken by idb_functions.h variables).
  Uniqueness fallback: if `X_new` itself exists (originals like
  TRIBE_Screen_Sed__command_new idb_functions.h:3561, decoder_input_new
  :6129 end in `_new`), escalate `X_new2`, `X_new3`, ... to first free
  name; cite the grep.
- 2026-11-14: `install_*` installer names verified collision-free
  (only a parameter `install_func`, common.h:90).
- 2026-11-14: Bake-in suggestions are report-only; applied only on
  explicit owner confirmation / OVERRIDE (template constraint 7).
- 2026-11-14: Subsystem directories are convenience-only. Reuse an
  existing `src/engine/` subsystem first; propose a new one with one-line
  reasoning. Approved derivations so far: (none ratified yet).
- 2026-11-14: All repository edits are approval-gated (template
  constraint 9), including this file and DECOMP_TEMPLATE.md.
- Pre-existing project conventions (observed, cited): __thiscall targets
  are replaced by `__fastcall f(Class* this_, DWORD dummy, args...)`
  (mousewheel.cpp:14, overlay.cpp:15, mpsetupscreen.cpp:171, land.cpp:4);
  engine globals use the pointer-to-slot convention `(*glob)->field`
  (aiactions.cpp:4, common.cpp:7).
- 2026-11-14: base_game typing mismatch is a known historical artifact.
  The IDB types the global as `TRIBE_Game*` (battlegrounds_x2.c:43930);
  the repo defines `RGE_Base_Game** const` (common.h:102, bound at
  common.cpp:7 = 0x006A3684). Ruling: ALL `base_game->field` in
  decompiled source translate to `(*base_game)->field`, with fields
  grounded via `RGE_Base_Game` (the repo's static type). Both structs are
  fully defined (idb_types.h:16758-16876 and :17448-17619; identical
  prefix, `world` at :16827/:17517 — see Verified type hierarchy). A
  decompiled access to a TRIBE_Game-only field (beyond RGE_Base_Game's
  body) cannot compile through the repo typing → Information Request.
- 2026-11-14: The functionlist.cpp profiler is effectively dead code:
  setFunctionListHooks() is block-commented (functionlist.cpp:9199-9216)
  and its only call site is commented out (dllmain.cpp:363). Footnote:
  if ever revived, it must skip engine-tree-owned addresses (its table
  already lists get_sprite @ functionlist.cpp:2111).

## Verified type hierarchy

Relations verified by mechanical comparison of field/slot sequences
(vfptr-normalized: the vfptr field's named vtable type legitimately
differs per class). Re-verify after any idb_types.h regeneration.
Verified-unrelated verdicts are recorded here too — they justify future
cast hard stops.

- RGE_Base_Game ⊂ TRIBE_Game — derived extends by 53 fields
  (117 base + 53 = 170); vtbls 99/99 slots, names identical in order.
  Evidence: struct prefix idb_types.h:16759-16876 vs :17449-17619;
  vtbl slot names :16887-16985 vs :17627-17725. Verified 2026-11-14.
  Runtime note: the base_game global is IDB-typed `TRIBE_Game*`
  (battlegrounds_x2.c:43930) — IDA's own runtime-type evidence for
  base→derived access on this chain; repo slot type `RGE_Base_Game**`
  (common.h:102).

## Open suspicions

(none open. Closed 2026-11-14: "base_game IDB address unverified" —
superseded by the base_game typing ruling; the repo definition is
authoritative.)

- Patch call-site volume: 2,552 active lines matched the full writer
  grep (Layer-1 names + `reloc(` + direct Write*/WriteProcessMemory;
  commented lines excluded), 2026-11-14. Re-verify: rerun the writer grep.
- Whole-repo address-bytes grep (e.g. `48B8|48B9`) is the decisive
  complement to per-site writer greps: it catches table-driven and
  macro-hidden targets. It located the dormant profiler reference to
  get_sprite (functionlist.cpp:2111) that per-site greps missed.

## Function ledger

- RGE_Master_Static_Object::get_sprite @ 0x0048B8B0 — cleaned in test run
  2026-11-14; gate PASSED (incl. cast gate: no casts in this function).
  Formal collision audit executed 2026-11-14: 2,552 active call sites
  scanned, 0 overlaps with [0x0048B8B0, 0x0048B910); civLetterSet table
  clear (civletter.cpp:4-80, targets 0x52xxxx-0x53Axxx); whole-repo
  address grep found only the dormant profiler (functionlist.cpp:2111,
  see rulings). Status: presented in conversation, NOT approved, NOT
  written. Subsystem: `object` (owner choice, awaiting write approval).
